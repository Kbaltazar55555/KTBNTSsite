            <p>I am a Software Engineer who is passionate about the basics. I believe having strong foundational principles allows me to approach global strategy with a beginner’s mindset. I spent 10 years dedicating my life to improving customer journeys and evangelizing the power of data discovery and data democratization - leading these efforts across the APAC region achieving 92% retention rate YOY, and by designing better approaches for customer outreach and issue resolution. Looking ahead, I want to compliment my communication and leadership skills with my skills as a full stack software engineer, designing tangible, empathetic solutions that bridge colleagues and teams across cultures. My goal is to continue to improve global collaboration and normalize that approach to solve the complex business problems of tomorrow.</p>

        <p>It took me a while to fully realize my passion and talent within the tech community.  Starting out studying politics and law, I had intentions to go to law school, but switched in 2012 to technical support. </p>
        <p>Through that one role, I found myself interested in data, architecture, and development and evenutally landed at Tableau in 2014. To further accelerate my understanding, I took Lean Six Sigma certification course, and most recently General Assembly Software Engineering Intensive certification course. </p>

          <q>I worked with Kenneth during a period of great change in our organisation. Kenneth , was based in NYC and I was in Sydney - and Kenneth went out of his way to ensure he could make West Coast and APAC meetings. HI approach to Strategic program management is refreshing as he always takes a learners mindset to any task he is given. A consumate professional who delivers to timing requested through collaborating with teams across Tableau to ensure he produces the most complete programs for our teams. I would not hesitate to have Kenneth in my team again in the future</q>

          <q>I was incredibly fortunate to get to work with Kenneth while we were both in program management roles. Our remit changed a lot during that time, moving from hyperfocused work standing up new teams and functions to broad integration efforts as part of the integration of Tableau and MuleSoft. We had a lot of challenges and surprises during that time, but Kenneth was always even keeled, and was always able to chart a path forward. I leaned on him heavily to help make sense of our changing priorities, and to identify positive action steps in any situation. His bias towards the customer and efficiency gave him a great perspective that was respected by our peers and leaders. He has a knack for storying telling, summarizing 3 weeks of meetings into a meaningful status report and action items, or articulating a problem statement in a way that is widely understood and actionable. He also was fantastic at building and maintaining relationships with our global team that are critical for our work. I'd look forward to any opportunity to work with Kenneth in the future.</q>
